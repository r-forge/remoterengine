we probably need to set up a wiki page somewhere to discuss these details instead of this TODO file

callbacks: 
	I (RF) have created class RemoteRMainLoopCallbacks for this purpose, 

	there are basically two types of callbacks: 
		- ones called when R needs to inform the clients, 
		about its state (rBusy, ...), which are going to be easy to do I guess. 

		- two (rReadConsole, rChooseFile) that need information back from the clients, which are 
		going to be slightly more tricky. They probably require to set up some sort of background thread
		that waits until the client has made the response available
