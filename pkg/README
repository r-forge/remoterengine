to build the R package, the recommended way is this

$ R CMD build RemoteREngine

this creates a tar.gz file

# R CMD INSTALL --clean RemoteREngine_0.0-5.tar.gz

( this has the advantage of not adding the compiled files into the project )

the startup script for the Remote R engine is located in the exec directory 
of the installed package, you can start it like this :

$ `Rscript -e "system.file( 'exec', 'remoterengine', package = 'RemoteREngine' ) " ` --name test --port 1099

or

$ Rscript -e "RemoteREngine::start.server()" -name test

On my system I have this alias set up: 

alias re="R CMD /usr/local/lib/R/library/RemoteREngine/exec/remoterengine"
so that I can just do : 

$ re --name test
$ re --name test --port 1099
$ re
