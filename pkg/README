to build the R package, the recommended way is this

$ R CMD build RemoteREngine

this creates a tar.gz file

# R CMD INSTALL RemoteREngine_0.0-0.tar.gz

this has the advantage of not adding the compiled files into the project

then, you can start the engine like this (more options will come)

$ R CMD remoterengine
